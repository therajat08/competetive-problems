# TUF - Take You Forward

* participate in contests for speed and concentration
* along, practice on a2oj and learn new algo
	- for this keep alternate days
* for learning any algo, go to CF nd do in ascending order of submission
* order of doing:
	-pattern printing problem
	- learn complexity analysis
	- liear search and cicular array
	- pallindrome and perfect num, armstrong, num,,,, problems
	- simple hashing problems
	- prefix sum problems, both 1d and 2d
 	- sliding window technique
	- binary search must
	- GCD of two numbers in LogN (euclidiean and extended euclidean)
	- linear diphantine equeation
	- checking prime in sqrt(n) complexity
	- sieve of eratosthenes
	- segmented sieve
	- finding prime factorization of a num in logN per querry
	- euler totient function
	- fermat little theorem
	- wilson's theorem

* Tougher version theory:
	-finding x^n in LogN
	- Modular Arithementic
	- Modular inversre of a number
	- Modular Expontentiation
	- Chinese remainder theorm
	-  Factorial modulo mod
	- findnig ncr and npr for querries
	- inclusion and exclusion principle (dont solve DP now)
	- learn basic sorting algorithms
	- do problems with Constructive and swapping in it
	- releated to 2 pointer approach
	- Read about bit manipulation
	- power set of given array / string
	- Number of Subarrays with XOR as zero (not algo but must do)
	- greedy algo problems
	-	-kadane's algo
		- job sequencing and activity selection
		

* Learn recursion 
- lot of basic recursion problem
		- Implement Binary Search
		- implement modular exponentiation
		- problem like finding subset with given sum 
	- make grip strong for DP
	- Learn about merge and Quick sort
	- solve merge sort problem like count inversion 
	- do back tracking problem like Sudoku and N queen problem(helpful for DP)
	- 

* once done with recursion
	-meet and middle algo and solve its problems
	-lot of divide and conquer (CF recommended)
	- Next Greater element / next smaller element using stack
	- Problemms related to parenthesis.
	- Largest Rectangular Area in Histogram(concept used a lot)
	- problems related to Heap (priority queue)
 <End of basic topics>

*Ladvanced topics
  - Learn about hashing on Strings and solve problems (CP algo has a good article)
  - Rabin karp algo
  - Prefix function
  - KMP ALgorithm
  - Z-function
  - Manchester's Algo
  - solve problems on diff platforms (25-30)
### done with string algo
* moving to tree
	- tree graph representation
	- DFS/BFS Traversal
	- diameter,height,level etc of a tree
	- Euler tour of a tree
	- Finding LCA using Euler Tree
	- Findng LCA using Binary Lifting
	- Distance between two nodes
	- Subtree problems
	- Spoj has good ones and D E of CF are good
* tree end>
